Halloween CYOA
------------------------
(1) Halloween is approaching soon at Chapel Hill and things are spookier than ever. A large stone spider on campus and rests across the scariest building of all, Phillips Hall. Lights are flashing in the mysterious Gimghoul Castle. The wind is always blowing, the trees are swaying, and raindrops are tinged with red. Are you scared yet?

- (2) Yes. Please take me back home where life is much simpler and safe.
- (3) Nope. Nothing about UNC is inherently scary. Bring it on!

------------------------
(2) You decided to leave campus and missed out on the best Halloween UNC had ever had. Everyone on campus bonded over their shared Halloween experience.

------------------------
(3) It's a week before the spooky day and you have so much to do! You are so overwhelmed by the things you have to do and the things you want to do. 

Firstly, do you have your costume(s) figured out?
- (4) Yup! My costumes are amazing!
- (5) Nope! Need to figure out something last minute!

------------------------
(4) You need to decide what to do next. One of your terrible professors has a midterm scheduled on November 1st. You also have been invited to way too many events and need to decide which ones to go to. Which do you prioritize?

- (6) Study for midterm on Nov 1
- (7) Confirm party plans with friends. A midterm is just a grade, Halloween memories are for life!

------------------------
(5) Since you absolutely need to have a Halloween costume, what do you do?

- (4) Browse online trying to figure out a last minute costume 
- (4) Reuse an old costume and hope that you will not get called out for it

------------------------
(6) As you study for your midterm, you realize that everything is hopeless. There's no way you can review everything properly to do well on the exam, have fun on Halloween, and sleep. What do you do?

- (8) Take an "L" and go all out for Halloween and sleep afterwards
- (9) Email the professor begging for mercy and email the class a petition to change the date of the midterm
- (10) Forgo sleep. Work hard and play hard!

------------------------

(7) You call up each and every one of your friends to confirm plans and they are all shocked that you are going to blow off that midterm. They decide to distance themselves from you because you are a slacker. You no longer have all the party invites and are forced to spend your Halloween alone, studying into the night.

------------------------

(8) You had a great time at Halloween! The Franklin Street parade was amazing and you had so much fun partying with your friends! When you get back to your room, you immediately crash onto your bed, falling asleep and starting to dream...

- (11) Continue

------------------------

(9) All your classmates agree with you and you all send a signed petition to the professor. You even got Carol Folt to sign! The professor relents, pushing back the midterm an extra week! You are heralded as a hero by your classmates, and your spirits are high for Halloween!

- (12) Continue

------------------------

(10) You studied for your test on All Hallow's Eve (oct 30) and are ready to destress with some relaxed fun! When you wake up on Halloween your muscles are stiff and you have a headache. You vaguely remember a large spider at your window last night, but you are not sure what happened. 

- (13) Continue

------------------------

(11) You jolt awake from you bad dream to see a tornado incoming. The large spider scultpure is flying in the air. Wisps of white are floating in the air and resemble ghosts. As they head to your dorm, you and your friends decided to run for your lives. As you are fleeing, you notice that no building have lights on, none except for the intimidating Phillips Hall. <br> What do you do?

- (14) Keep running. Phillips Hall is a very scary place to get lost in.
- (15) Enter Phillips Hall because the lights are on. It could be a sanctuary.

------------------------

(12) It's Halloween and you are ready to have some fun! Where do you want to go first?

- (16) Go to Franklin Street! It will be nice seeing all the fun costumes!
- (17) Warm up on the festivities by watching a spooky movie!

------------------------

(13) It doesn't take long for you to realize you are a zombie/vampire hybrid. You instinctively attack any human you see. Soon everyone at UNC is an undead being. You don't know what to think about your new powers, but you know that you will miss being able to sleep ever again. 

------------------------

(14) You keep running past Phillips Hall and collide with the former pedestal of Silent Sam. The ghosts catch up with you. They circle around you and your friends and perform a ritualistic sacrifice to take away your personalities. Afterwards you are hypnotized into thinking that this was the "Best Halloween Ever." After feeding on your personalities, the ghosts attack the rest of Chapel Hill.

------------------------

(15) You and your friends enter the safest place in Phillips Hall - the basement. Surely no one can find you there. You encounter a friendly ghost, Moaning Myrtle, who promises to protect you. She takes you all through all of Phillips and you realize that Phillips isn't that scary. Later, in the morning you take your midterm and fail it. You resolve to be a better student and now greatly appreciate the power of Phillips Hall. 

------------------------

(16) On your way walking back from Franklin Street, you and your friends feel a compulsion to walk towards the woods. You end up entering Forest Theatre where you see a cluster of witches pouring things into a cauldron. You aren't sure if they are real witches or if they just dressed up but ask them what they are doing. They are performing a ritual to ensure the continued success of UNC, and they have been doing it for 225 years! You and your friends end up helping the witches in this secret task and are awed by the events. You all know this is the best Halloween everand nothing can ever compare to this!

------------------------

(17) The movie was very enjoyable and you all feasted on lots of sugary treats! You ended the night trying to scare little children on Franklin Street. All in all, you thought it was a calm, relaxing Halloween.
