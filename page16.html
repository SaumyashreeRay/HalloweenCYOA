        <h1>On your way walking back from Franklin Street, you and your friends feel a compulsion to walk towards the woods. You end up entering Forest Theatre where you see a cluster of witches pouring things into a cauldron. You aren't sure if they are real witches or if they just dressed up but ask them what they are doing. They are performing a ritual to ensure the continued success of UNC, and they have been doing it for 225 years! You and your friends end up helping the witches in this secret task and are awed by the events. You all know this is the best Halloween ever and nothing can ever compare to this! </h1>
